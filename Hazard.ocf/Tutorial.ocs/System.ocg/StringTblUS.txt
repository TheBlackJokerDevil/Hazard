Drones=Drones

Intro1=Halt, soldier! Welcome to the training center.
Intro2=My name is Grodon Freimann, I'm the one in charge here. And your instructor today. Now you're going to have a bit fun with the big guns.
Intro3=At first you need a weapon. Meet the doc, he'll give you one. Just jump on the ladder and climb up to him. Then you use the lift and take the exit to the right.

Doc1=Greetings, I'm the Doc.
DocWeapon=I'm here for the weapon.
Doc2=Ah, a new guena pig.. Erm, a new soldier. I'm already informed. Here's you weapon. Our newest pistol-prototype, codename \"Jackal\", straight from the lab.
DocThx=Thanks
DocEasterEgg=I belong to RedWolf Design GmbH!

Tutor1=Good. But you're lacking ammunition. Collect the ammo packet there.

Tutor2=You're able to check your ammo supplies on the HUD in the bottom left corner of the screen.
Tutor2b=The ammo pack stays in your inventory if you have more ammo than what fits into your supply. You can refill by using the ammo pack.
Tutor3=Now you're ready, let's start. Load your weapon via %s and shoot the target.
Tutor4=Reloading happens automatically if you press %s while you are out of ammo, but you can reload any time using the %s button.

Tutor5=Well done, but that was easy.
Tutor6=Try hitting a moving target! Show us what you can do.

Tutor7=Well done, well done. Now it's getting interesting, you get to try out the grenade launcher. Enter the teleporter to the right.

Tutor8=It's lying back there. But to get it, you have to overcome this obstacle. You wont be able to simply jump over it.
Tutor9=Do you remember your elite training? Right, it's time for the flip! Go to the edge, try to jump and double-press %s or %s.

Tutor10=Okay, you got it! There's the drone, eliminate the target.

Tutor11=Well, wasn't that fun? But plain grenades are boring, aren't they? The next one'll be reduced to dust by a cluster grenade! The grenadelauncher has already been upgraded. We'll come to upgrading later.
Tutor11b=Load the cluster grenades and then fire at will!

Tutor12=Wham, poor drone. But look, it lost something. Looks like a laser.
Tutor13=Luckily we use standard components everywhere. You can upgrade your pistol with the laser. To do so, choose the Laser and press %s.

Tutor14=Now your pistol is shoots with a laser! But to do so, you need energy. Go back to the surface, new equipment awaits you.
Tutor15=Open the firemode-menu via %s. You'll see, that the standard shot is gone and that there's an laser-firemode instead.
Tutor16=If you haven't noticed yet: the pistol also has a second firemode. It's able to shoot grenades! Don't ask me how, our sciensist are just good.
Tutor16b=You can also cycle through the firemodes with %s. The mode that you selected last will be activated after a moment.

Tutor17=This is a jetpack. It allows you to move rapidly with short boosts. To use it, equip it by pressing %s.
Tutor18=Then double-press %s or %s/%s while jumping. Try to reach that edge up there now.

Tutor19=Okay, now it's time to use the laser.

Tutor20=Boom, the next one down. If you continue like that, we'll run out of drones.
Tutor21=Look, another laser. But you don't have a weapon to upgrade. But look what the drone up there is holding! A bazooka!
Tutor22=The bazooka is upgradeable with a laser. It's able to shoot homing missiles then.
Tutor23=You don't need the pistol anymore, also you're out of grenades. However, you still got some energy. The grenade launcher is able to shoot EMP-grenades (if you used an upgrade - we've already done that now). You can take out the drone with that, go on and try!
Tutor24=Your goal is to get the bazooka and upgrade it.
	
Tutor25=Well done. With homing missiles you can hit targets, that not directly strikeable because the path is blocked.
Tutor26=To the right, there's an old storage. Your next target awaits you there.

Tutor27=Here comes the particle cannon! This lovely weapon is waiting for you on the plateau.

Tutor28=The primary firemode is a strong energy ray, that allows to hit multiple targets at the same time.
Tutor29=The secondary firemode fires an energyball that disables all technical devices, just like the EMP-Grenade. Try it out!

Tutor30=You made it. Now here's the mother of all weapons: the minigun!
Tutor31=We'll give you one. And lots of ammonition. now guess what's your target... ;)

TutorEND=Congratulation, you made it. You're a pretty well trained Hazard now. Your first mission awaits you, %s.
